## Android Development Fall 2013

This repository contains some of the more interesting projects I worked on 

during my Android Dev class at Siena.

### Homework4

This folder contains the Android source code for my Bitcoin exchange rate app

I used the JSON API located at https://bitcointy.herokuapp.com to pull

real-time exchange rates on different exchanges.


### MagicCardScraper

This folder contains the Android source code for an app me and my team members

developed that acquires the current price of any Magic The Gathering playing

card and saves the price and date it was searched for.  Our professor is a big

fan of Magic the Gathering so we figured he might get some use out of this 

for our last homework assignment.
